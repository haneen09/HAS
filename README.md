# Interactive Home Automation System (Python)

An interactive Python-based Home Automation System that lets users create, control, and manage devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. The system responds to user commands, preferences, and schedules, creating a connected environment.

## Purpose
To design a simulation that demonstrates how home devices can be controlled remotely and adjusted according to user preferences or preset events.
